Hi Team, Todays Topic

INDEX
   -Index is a database objects that makes data retrieval faster
   -index will speed up the searching of the data from the database tables
   -It is also retrieve the vast amount of data from the table frequently
   -Index require its own hard disk 
   
  syntax:
       create index index_name on table_name(column_name);
	   
	   when we want to create index on multiple tables:
	   -----------------------------------------------
       create index index_name on table_name(column_name1,column2,column3...); 
  
  
Types of Index

B tree Index :
  Binary tree index,this index helps with sorting data from the table ,used to search the data faster whenever the data is vast'
  
Unique Index :
     -unique index are indexes helps to maintain data integrity , by insuring the no rows in the table contains the duplicate values
non Unique Index
     -non-unique: it allows the multiple of same value in the column
Composite  :
     -used to apply the index for more than one column.
BitMap Index :
     -used whenever the column contains less distinct values
	 syntax:
	   create BITMAP demo_index on table_name(column_name);
Functional Index

 

Ques and Topics related to index 



1.index? 
      Indexes are the database objects , which are help to maintain the data integrity ,
	  by insuring the no two rows in the table contain duplicate values
	  -Indexes speed up the data searching ability in the table 
	  
2. type of indexes ?
      -unique and non-unique index
	  -b tree index
	  -BitMap Index
	  -functionl index
	  -composite index
	  
        
3. When to create index 

      if the table having huge volume of records and the

      column is used frequently in where clause that column requires index 

4. what is bit map index :
      -bitmap indexing is the technique, which enable data to retrieved quickly from the columns that are frequently used and 
	  have a low cardinality
	    cardinality: count of distinct element in the column
      -if count of the distinct element is less, then we call it as low cardinality
	  syntax:
	     create bitmap 
5. diff between unique and non unique index 
          unique: it allows only one value once in the column
		  non-unique: it allows the multiple of same value in the column
6. how to list all available index from a table 
         -select * from user_indexes;
7. how to identify a column having index or not ?
    -- select * from USER_IND_COLUMNS where TABLE_NAME ='EMP_CPY';
    -- select * from USER_IND_COLUMNS where TABLE_NAME = UPPER('emp_cpy'); 

8. how to identify the qry is using index or not > 

9. if the qry goes to full table scan , what we have to do ? 

      - we have to check the where clause column having index or not 

      -if index is not there then, create a new index for the column 

      - if the index is there and it is not used by the qry then 

      - check the index status and do the index  rebuild     

10. how to rebuild the index 

11. when to rebuild the index 

      - if the index is there and it is not used by the qry then 

      - check the index status and do the index  rebuild     

12. if i use nvl in where clause ,  index will work or not ? 

13. how to drop the index 

     drop index idx0001;

14.  can i create index for all table columns 

  no , index has to be create the frequently used columns in where clause 

15. maximum number of available column in composite index? 
     -16 columns
	 -All the columns in a composite index key must be in the same table
16. we cannot create composite index for 2 varchar2(4000) length columns.

17.can we create index on foriegn column

 

Interview Qns Mview: 

 1. What is mview? 
   -it is a materialized view is a database object it contains the results of the query 
   -Data is physically stored in the database 

    syntax:
   Create materialized view View_Name

   Build [Immediate/Deffered]

   Refresh [Fast/Complete/Force]

   on [Commit/Demand]

   as Select ..........;
   
	1.Build Immediate: Means materialized views(mv) created immediately.

	2.Build Deferred: Means materialized views(mv) created after one refresh.

	3.Refresh on commit:

	This option committed the data in materialized views in SQL immediately after data inserted and committed in table. This option is known as incremental refresh option. 
	View is not fully refreshed with this option

	4.Refresh on Demand:

	Using this option you can add the condition for refreshing data in materialized views.   

 2. when to create m view ? 
    -when we want the faster response,when we need a partial refresh
	-m view store the data in the database, 

 3. what are refresh methods? 

 4. diff between immediate and differed 
   Build Immediate: Means materialized views(mv) created immediately.

	Build Deferred: Means materialized views(mv) created after one refresh.

 5. what is mview logs ? 

 6. diff between fast/ force / complete 
 
        fast refresh/incremental refresh:
		--When in database level some DML changes are done then Oracle 
		Database stores rows describing those changes in the materialized view log and then uses the materialized view log to refresh materialized views based on the master table.
		This process is called incremental or fast refresh. 
          --it takes less time compare to complete refresh
		complete refresh;
		 Without a materialized views log, Oracle Database must re-execute the materialized view query to refresh the materialized views. 
		 This process is called a complete refresh. 
		 --it takes more time compare to fast refresh
 7. list out fast refresh restrictions ? 

        if mview has deferred build clause then, fast refresh not possible 

        if the mview not contain primary key column in select clause qry then, fast refresh not possible 

        if the mview qry has group by , fast refresh will not work 

 8. diff between on commit / on demand 
        on commit: this option will committed the data in the mview after the data inserted and commited in the table 
		          -it is a incremental refresh option, view doest not referesh completly

        on demamd: This option is used to add condition to refresh the data in the mview
 9. query rewrite ? 
     -When base tables contain large amount of data, it is expensive and time-consuming to compute
	 the required aggregates or to compute joins between these tables.
	 In such cases, queries can take minutes or even hours. 
	 Because materialized views contain already precomputed aggregates and joins, 
     -becs mview already oracle database brought powerful process called QUERY REWRITE, to quickly answer the query using materialized views.
 10. diff between view / mview 
                https://www.stechies.com/difference-between-view-materialized-view/        

 11. can we create index on mviews ?
       yes

 12. is mview will occupy the storage ? 
     -yes

  13. how to refresh mviews ?

 

Interview qs for View!

1.what is view 
  -view is a virtual table that does not exist physically,It is stored in the data dictionary and do no store any data
  -It can be executed when called
2. what are type of views ? 
       simple view
	   :simple view contains only single base table
	   complex view
	   :complex view can be constructed on multiple base table
	    -we can use joins,group by order by clause
3. what is use of views ? 
    -Views are used as security purpose because they provide the encapsulation to the name of the table
	-Data is stored in the virtual table, not permanently ans views can display only selected data
	
4. can we do dml in views ? 
     - view is stored as a SELECT statement in the database. DML operations on a view like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE 
	 affects the data in the original table upon which the view is based. 
     -DML operations on views can be performed as long as the view does not contain these words: 
	   DISTINCT, GROUP BY, START WITH, CONNECT BY, ROWNUM,
	     complex view contains group by clause, so we cant do the dml in complex view
		 
5. how to restrict dml in simple view? 
    --We can restrict the dml op in view with 'WITH READ ONLY' option
	--This clause indictates that view created with read only, no write op allowed , if we try to do any DML op , oracle raise an error

6. can we create view for non existing tables ? 
    yes
	:if a view refers to a non-existent table or an invalid column of an existing table or 
	if the owner of the view does not have the required privileges, 
	then the view can still be created and entered into the data dictionary.

7. if we add any new column in the base table  after creation of the view, 

   that new column will be added in the view or not? 

8. diff between drop & create view and create or replace view 

drop view:  DROP VIEW statement is used to remove or delete view completely
create view: CREATE VIEW statment is used to create the oracle view
create or replace: CREATE OR REPLACE statement is used to modify the definition of oracle view without dropping it

9. what is with check option? 
    -check constraints used to provide condtion in the sql statement

10. can we create index on the views ?
   -yes
   -first index created on view must be unique clustered index
   -once unique clustered index created, we can create the multiple non clusted index

 

What is Procedure ?
   -Procedures are stored procedure, which is used for reusability
   -we can run the procedure as many time as possible
   -execute once and used it again and again
   -no return type used in the procedures
   
What is Function?
   --used for the reusablity and have a return type
 functions:
 -dml statements can not be executed in functions
 -if we use dml statemenrts in functions, we can not use those functions in select statements
 -if we want to use use dml and call that function in select statements , then we have to make the transction as autonomous transaction
   
What is Anonymous Block ?
     -a block of code , which has a no name
	 -anonymous block does not stored in the database,once it executes data will be lost
