Hi Team, Please topics for today

 

****************************Procedure********************************
1.  it is DB object ,
2.  it will stored inside the database
3.  it accepts parameters ( In / Out / In out )
4.  We cannot assign values to in parameters inside of the procedure
5.  If we are not mentioing " in" at the parameter ,
        it will consider as input parameteR
6.  procedure can be invoke (call) from anonymous block/ procedure /function
7.  one procedure can be called from multiple session at the same time
8.  PROCEDURE MAY OR MAY NOT RETURN VALUE - means , proceure may or may not have output parameters
9.  PROCEDURE PERFORMS ACTION
10. PROCEDURE IS USED TO CREATE NEW TRANSACTIONS, DELETE/MODIFY EXISTING TRANSACTIONS
11. Default parameter can be added in procedures, if we give any value while calling it will take the
     given value for execution

 

     if we not provided value for default parameter, it will execute the procedure with default value
has context menu

 

******************Interview********************
1.     What is anonymus block? and what is use of anonymous block?
2.     Structure of anonymus block?
        DECLARE
		BEGIN
		EXCEPTION
		END
		
3.     What is cursor ? and type of cursors?
       -Cursors are pointers, which holds the sql satatement executed data temporarly.
	   -Types:
	    IMPLICIT Cursor
		EXPLICIT Cursor
4.     diff between implicit and explicit cursor
5.     what are cursor attributes:
          ISOPEN : This cursor attribute checks , whether cursor is open or not
		       -Always returns FALSE for implicit cursors, 
			    because Oracle closes the SQL cursor automatically after executing its associated SQL statement.
		  FOUND  :
		   -It returns true
		         -whenever any update delete insert statment affected one or more rows, or
				 -Whenever the Select INTO statement returns rows
		   -else it returns false
				 
		  NOTFOUND   :
		   -It returns true
		         -whenever any update delete insert statment affected no rows, or
				 -Whenever the Select INTO statement returns no rows
		   -else it returns false
		  ROWCOUNT
		  We use sql%attribute_name to access all above cursor attributes
		  
6.     how to find a DML statement is affecting any records inside the procedure?
       -By calling the procedure
	   -and checking the rows of the table.
7.     what is procedure ?
       -Procedures are the stored database objects, once procedure executed we can call mutilple times whenever needed
	   -procedure has no return value, instead OUT parameter is used to get the value from procedure
8.     can we assign values to input parameter of the procedure ?
9.     what is default parameter
          -default parameter executed when the parameters are not mentioned explicitly
10.    what is in out parameter?
11.    can I call a procedure from another procedure ?
******************************Types of Cursor************************************

      cursors are the pointers which has temparory memory pointing to the sql query results set

1.Implicit Cursor
         -select statement 
		   insert ,update,delete
2.Explicit Cursor
          -we have to create the own cursor manually, and use it wheever we needed it
		  open()
		  fetch
		  close()
		  
		  
 

*****************************Cursor Attributes**********************************

 

ISOPEN  -- it returns true when the cursor is in opened state
FOUND   -- it shows the cursor having records inside
NOTFOUND  -- it shows the cursor doesnot having records inside
ROWCOUNT  -- it shows number of records available inside the cursor

 

****************************Function*******************************************

 

1. function is a DB object
   yes
2. function must return value
    yes
3. function will return a value by default
4. function can return multiple values by using of out parameters
5. functions can be called from select clause / sql statements
6. function performs calculations / validation
7. function can be return multiple records,if the function having return type of sys_refcursor/nested tables

 

8. When we cannot call the functions through the select clause
    1. if the function having out/ inout parameters
    2. if the function retunrs sql un supported data types
          varray,refcursor
    3. if the function having DML inside without the pragma autonomous_transaction

 

***********************Interview************************

 

What is functions?
 
when to create functions ?
      Functions can be created , whenever we want to use same code again and again
	  -reusablilty
	  -Functions can return values
Diff between functions and procedure ?

        functions                                                             procedures
		
1.A function has return type and return value                           A procedure does not have return value, but it returns using OUT parameter
2.We cannot use a function with Data Manipulation queries.             We can use DML queries such as insert,update,delete,select...
    Only Select queries are allowed in functions.
3.A function does not allow output parameter                             Procedures allows both IN AND OUT parameters

4.We cannot manage transactions inside a function.                      We can manage transactions inside a function.

5.We cannot call stored procedures from a function                      We can call functions from the procedures 

6.We can call function using select statement                           We can not call procedure using select statement


can function have out parameter?
            no
can function return multiple values or not?
                  no
can function contains DML ?
   -You cannot use a function with Data Manipulation queries. Only Select queries are allowed in functions.
  -You can use DML inside a PL/SQL function. However, the function can only be called from PL/SQL, not from SQL.
  
when we cannot call the functions from select clause
-A function can be called from a select statement as long as it does not alter data.
How you determine the program has to be created as function/ procedure ?
   -when we want to return only one value, then we have to use function
   -When we want to return more then one value, we will go for procedures


note:
Technically, calling a stored procedure from a function is possible. 
But remember the purpose of the stored procedure and functions.

Purpose of function: The function is used to compute a value and hence must return a value.
 A function can be called from a select statement as long as it does not alter data. (Permanent table data, not temp tables)

Purpose of Stored procedure: The stored procedure is used to execute business 
logic and hence may or may not return a value.
